An active Medical Emergency Response System.   In case of medical emergencies just push the button and it transfers your location to the nearest Medical Emergency Response Crew (Ambulances, Hospitals, Doctors, ...).  It doesn't stop there - it calculates an optimal meeting point and keeps tracking both your car's as well as the response crew vehicle's locations as you both travel towards each other. It guides both the vehicles so that you can avoid the dreadful waiting-for-the-ambulance time.  Alongside, it sends out notifications about your current condition as well as your previous medical records to the nearest suitable hospital(s) equipped and qualified to treat your condition.  It thus takes care of all logistics till the very moment you have safely been taken to the hospital.
